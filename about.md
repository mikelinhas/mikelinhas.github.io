# About Me

I started developing software back in 2014 after I graduated from my Industrial Engineering degree. My first learning curve was with MongoDB, NodeJS and AngularJS. I developed a small scale production MRP for a packaging company.

Since then I have kept on searching and leaning new technologies. I am always willing to take up new and exciting projects.
