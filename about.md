# About Me

I'm a software developer constantly searching for new technologies. My personal favorites, and those which I use in most of my projects are NodeJS, MongoDB, VueJS, and ReactJS. I have used Python frameworks such as Django and Flask, and really like building apps inside containers with Docker. My current approach is trying to go serverless, collecting data with AWS Lambda, IoT Core, and DynamoDB.
