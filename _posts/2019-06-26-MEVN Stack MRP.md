title: MEVN Stack MRP
---

In 2018 I decided to help out some friends who were starting to grow their fashion business. Their sales and production had really taken off and they needed to track their warehouses, production and supplier purchases. At this point in time, companies nedd to decide either to build or to buy an MRP. Thankfully for me, they decided to build.

**VueJS** was becoming extremely popular and after testing it with some small ideas, it seemed like a good choice. The MRP was going to include complex calls to the database, so I decided to use **MongoDB** and **NodeJS**.

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Hyde.
